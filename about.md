Hi! I'm David Norcott, a software developer from Boston, MA. I've been writing software professionally since 2005 and unprofessionally since 1995 (some might argue that I never stopped writing unprofessionally). I've always been focused on mobile software since my first "real" job (remember when BlackBerry was a thing?).

When I'm not writing iOS apps for [Rue La La](http://www.ruelala.com/) you can probably find me in the Great Outdoors, hiking, cycling, or sailing. Or on a rainy day, playing guitar or fiddle.

###Why norchops.com?
It all goes back to my college days when I had big sideburns. For reference, I looked a whole lot like this picture of the Russian playwright Alexander Pushkin:

###About You
That's what I want to know! Drop me a line.
