Hi! I'm David Norcott, a software developer from Boston, MA. I've been writing software professionally since 2005 and unprofessionally since the first time I sat in front of my family's [Apple II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II_series#Apple_IIe) (though some might argue that I never stopped writing unprofessionally). I've been focused on mobile software since my first "real" job (remember when BlackBerry was a thing?).

When I'm not writing iOS apps for [Rue La La](http://www.ruelala.com/) you can probably find me in the great outdoors, hiking, cycling, or sailing. And on a rainy day, playing guitar or fiddle.

### Why [norchops.com](http://www.norchops.com)?
It all goes back to my college days when I had big sideburns. For reference, I looked a whole lot like this picture of the Russian playwright [Alexander Pushkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Pushkin):
